Project by @PrismaticNES

The goal of the this repository is to be able to hold and utilize .css and .js files for a small wiki project that I'm making for a few friends and I.

I tried utilizing Google Drive, and although I got images to work, .css and .js files don't. 

Thus, I'm hoping to have more success utilizing GitHub.
